Backend (Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL):

An Express.js server provides a secure RESTful API for user authentication, managing appointments, pharmacy orders, and health data.

User data, medical records, and inventory are stored in a relational PostgreSQL database, ensuring data integrity and structure.

Authentication is handled using JWTs, which are issued upon login and validated for all protected routes to secure user-specific actions.

Frontend (React.js):

The client is a dynamic and responsive single-page application built with React.

It provides a rich user interface for patients to find doctors, book virtual consultations, browse the pharmacy, and interact with their personalized diet plans.

It communicates with the backend via the RESTful API to fetch and display data, ensuring a seamless user experience.

AI Integration & Payments:

The AI-driven meal recommendation system is a core backend service. It processes user-provided health data (like age, weight, conditions) to generate tailored diet and meal suggestions.

The PayPal payment gateway is integrated on both the frontend and backend to handle secure transactions for all paid services, such as doctor's fees and medication purchases.
